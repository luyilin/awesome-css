            <p>Do you think I could stay here to become nothing to you ? Do you think because I’m poor and obscure and plain that I’m soulless and heartless? I have as much soul as you and fully as much heart. And if God had gifted me with wealth and beauty I should have made it as hard for you to leave me as it is now for me to leave you. There, I have spoken my heart now. Let me go.</p>
